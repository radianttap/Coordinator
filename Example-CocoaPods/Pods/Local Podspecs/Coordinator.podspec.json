  "summary": "Advanced Swift implementation of (Application) Coordinator software design pattern.",
  "description": "It implements a mechanism to allow custom messaging between any UIView, UIViewController and Coordinator, regardless of where in the hierarchy they are. Thus it side-steps the need for delegates all over your code. It simplifies testing and allows creation of self-contained visual boxes that do one thing and don’t care where are they embedded or presented.",
